# Rooibos

Create great webapps without a hassle.

**NOTE: It's very alpha and all**

# What's in there?

* jQuery, jQuery UI, Sammy.js, Mustache.js
* Aristo theme done with SASS and Compass
* And some custom code

# Compatibility

* IE8 is almost good
* There will be a compatibility layer for IE7 but I don't guarantee anything
* Opera... Don't have plans for it
